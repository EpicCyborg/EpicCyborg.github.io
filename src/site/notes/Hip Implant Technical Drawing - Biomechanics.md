For the Biomechanics subject, I created CAD for hip implant, as well as failure behaviour.

# Failure Behaviour of Implant
If the implant stem length is increased by 10%, then there will be a higher moment arm for the rotational motion of the hip, which means that 10% more compression force is exerted in the transverse direction at the distal end of the stem and vice versa.

However, for translation motion, a decrease or increase in stem length will proportionally change the area through which the force is distributed, with stress in the transverse plane of cortical bone inversely proportional, so increasing length decreases the distributed stress and probability of failure.

Assuming the implant is more dense than the apparent density of the bone, a 10% change in stem length will change the mass of the implant and the compression force on the bone in the longitudinal axis.
