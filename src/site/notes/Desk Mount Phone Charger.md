I designed, 3D printed and laser cut a working wireless phone charger, meeting the following requirements:
1. Holds my phone securely
2. Phone can easily be placed and removed
3. Charges my phone wirelessly
4. Minimises footprint on top of desk or other surfaces

The solution I came up with was a drawer that could slide out and hold the phone at a 45° angle, mounting under my desk to minimise footprint.
