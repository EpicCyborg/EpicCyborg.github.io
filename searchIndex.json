		"content": "Dinosaur Animation (Blender)\n\nOne of the requirements for this project was to have expressive animations. My task was to create a seamless workflow . I had prior experience modelling and rigging characters in Blender, so I applied it to this project through the following steps:\n\nExport .fbx files of the mechanisms from CAD software (Fusion 360)\nImport the entire model into Blender\nRigging: Align armature joints with those on the model\nAdd inverse kinematics and ring objects that control orientation of head, eyes, and tail\nExport servo motor angles into C++ arrays using plugin\n\nUsing the software developed by other members of the team, this animation was able to be translated quickly into the actual model.\nCAD (Fusion 360)\n\n[!tip] Laser-Cut Body Frame Design",
