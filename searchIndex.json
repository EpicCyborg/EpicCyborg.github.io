Laser cutting was the primary fabrication method to cut down on fabrication time and cost for rapid prototyping. Mounting holes were placed so other parts, such as the 3D-printed neck mechanism. All geometry used the 3D model made by the team sculptor as a reference.\n3D-printed shells were made to capture the organic geometry of the dinosaur, such as the belly above, or parts for the head shown below. Since the silicone skin would go over, low polygon count was used to speed up the CAD software.\n\nAnimatronic Quokka\nFor the second animatronic, the quokka, I was animatronics team lead, in charge of administrative tasks for project management such as team meetings, organising events and inventory management. I also mentored team members in technical skills, while continuing technical work in 3D modelling, mechanical design, 3D printing and circuit design.\n\nEarly quokka head 3D model in Blender\n\nPrint-in-place quokka finger mechanism CAD\nThe following was the team's resulting head mechanism prototype:\n\nQuokka head prototype",

		"content": "For the VEX season 2022-2023 game &quot;Spin Up&quot;, team EMU5 built a catapult robot to score 3 discs at a time. I designed custom components for 2D CNC milling and 3D printing in SOLIDWORKS and Fusion 360 alongside assemblies and technical drawings.\n2D Components\n\nPolycarbonate chassis for reinforcement on C-channels\nThis was my first exposure to CAD in Fusion 360 and SOLIDWORKS, contributing to a disc shooting robot with remote-control and autonomous capability. I started contributing with 2D designs for custom parts fabricated using CNC milling on polycarbonate and aluminium. I learned to work closely with the more experienced builders on the team to understand the CAD thought process, then move on to 3D components. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/vex-robotics-competition-emu-5/#technical-drawings\">Technical drawings</a> were made alongside the components as part of the project log book.\n3D Printed Components\nTo optimise for 3D printing, I took into account print orientation, overhang angles, and plate contact area. Examples were gears and the tracking wheel mount that used springs to keep the tracking wheel on the ground at all times.\n\nMotor Mounts\nOne of the most important components was the motor mount. They had to be robust to withstand the force and heat of the motors, while also allowing them to be replaced easily since they would often overheat or wear out. I designed and iterated upon the motor mount to optimise for the following:\n\n[!abstract] Requirements\n\nMechanically secure attachment to robot\nEasy to take off and replace\nMinimise footprint\n\nVersion 1 of the custom motor mount was printed and used on the 2022-2023 robot. To improve upon the design further, for 2023-2024, I worked on an improved version that took less space, using a horizontal locking pin to detach and reattach them easily. The first revision was too tall, but I identified a lower space for the pin to go through by analysing the cross section. The final motor mount successfully optimised for space:\n\nSOLIDWORKS Assemblies\n\nI was tasked with creating the SOLIDWORKS assemblies and subassemblies since this would help us create our Bill of Materials. However, we realised that time constraint meant that parts had to be cut from the digital recreation, such as the overwhelming number of nuts, bolts and chains that took time to place, and caused the assembly file to lag the computer. Therefore, larger parts like C-channels, wheels and gears were prioritised, and mirroring was used for efficiency.\nThe disc intake module on the left was assembled independently based off physical prototypes, and combined to the main chassis assembly on the right.\nThrough this experience, I learned how to make assemblies in SOLIDWORKS using &quot;mates&quot;, and that each component required multiple mates to be fixed in place. The C-channels at right angles would require three coincident mates, while the gears and wheels on axles would only require one concentric and one coincident mate.\nCalculations for Pathfinding\nac=(X″(t))2+(Y″(t))2Fc=m(X″(t))2+(Y″(t))2I also assisted in calculations and implementation for the pathfinding algorithm, which used quintic spline. Centripetal force Fc needed to be minimised in the autonomous pathfinding algorithm to reduce error. The robot's odometry used cartesian coordinates, and was able to determine this by taking double derivatives of x and y coordinates. Fc would be minimised for the pathfinding algorithm.\nTechnical Drawings",
